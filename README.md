More accurate description can be seen [here](https://github.com/pawel002/Statistics-Project/blob/main/statistics.pdf) in Polish.

## Usage
After launching app user can see how diffrent values affect plots of distribution and distribution of averages. App automatically updates after inputing changes. Value SampleSize should be divisible by 100 or by a divisor of 100, only then the plots will generate. It's not a problem, because to show the correctness of CLT we want sample size to be as big as possbile.
